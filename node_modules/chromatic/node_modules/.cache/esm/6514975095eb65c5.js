    You appear to be rerunning an earlier build, because the baseline build has the same commit and branch name.
    Comparing against the same commit would yield zero changed files, so --only-changed would end up running a build with no snapshots.
    That's probably not what you want when rerunning a build, so we're just going to run a full build instead.
